# Everything Coding Agent

This skill exposes host-neutral workflows from `everything-coding-agent`.
Claude Code can still use the top-level `commands/` directory. Codex loads
this shared skill directory through `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`.

## PR Review Workflow

Use this workflow when the user asks for `review-pr`, PR review, or provides a
GitHub PR/Issue URL.

### 1. Resolve the Review Target

- Accept a GitHub PR URL, GitHub Issue URL, PR number, or "current branch PR".
- For a PR URL, fetch:

  ```bash
  gh pr view <url> --json number,title,body,headRefName,baseRefName,author,files,additions,deletions,labels,closingIssuesReferences,url
  ```

- For an Issue URL, fetch the issue and linked PRs:

  ```bash
  gh issue view <url> --json number,title,body,comments,url
  gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<number>/timeline --jq '[.[] | select(.source.issue.pull_request) | .source.issue.html_url]'
  ```

- If no explicit target is supplied, resolve the current branch PR with
  `gh pr view --json ...`.
- Stop with a clear error if the PR cannot be resolved.

### 2. Discover Related PRs

Look for related PRs before reviewing:

- PR body links matching `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/pull/<number>`.
- Linked PRs from `closingIssuesReferences`.
- Same branch name in sibling repositories when the organization and local
  checkout structure make that practical.

If multiple PRs are found, summarize them and ask the user which ones to
include. If none are found, review only the main PR.

### 3. Gather Diff and Project Guidance

For every selected PR:

```bash
gh pr diff <number> -R <owner>/<repo>
gh pr diff <number> -R <owner>/<repo> --name-only
```

Read available project guidance before judging style or architecture:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `README.md`
- language-specific lint/test config
- docs under `docs/guideline/` when present

Prefer reviewing from a local checkout or worktree when available. If a local
checkout is not available, use the `gh pr diff` output directly.

### 4. Summarize the PR

Before listing findings, write a short summary:

- repository and PR number/title
- author and head/base branches
- files changed, additions, deletions
- stated purpose from the PR body
- actual implementation summary from the diff
- risk hotspots such as schema changes, auth, payments, batch jobs, external
  service calls, or large generated diffs

### 5. Review Perspectives

Run the review from these perspectives. Use parallel subagents if the host
supports them; otherwise do the passes sequentially.

**General correctness and maintainability**

- behavior regressions
- missing edge cases
- error handling and recovery
- excessive complexity, duplication, or unclear ownership
- tests missing for changed behavior

**Security**

- hardcoded secrets or credentials
- injection risks
- broken authz/authn boundaries
- unsafe file paths or command execution
- sensitive data logging
- unsafe external input handling

**Language-specific review**

- Go: context as first parameter, error wrapping, goroutine lifecycle, race
  risks, SQL query performance, GORM batch insert patterns, map preallocation.
- TypeScript/JavaScript: type safety, React hook correctness, XSS, async error
  handling, cleanup of subscriptions/effects.
- Python: unsafe deserialization/eval, mutable defaults, missing resource
  cleanup, type and test gaps.

**Project-specific review**

Apply repository guidance and business rules. In this repository family, pay
extra attention to financial correctness, tenant scoping, migration safety,
OpenAPI-driven API changes, and data integrity.

### 6. Output Format

Lead with findings. Keep summaries secondary.

```markdown
## Findings

| Severity | File | Line | Issue |
|---|---|---:|---|
| CRITICAL | path/file.go | 42 | Short issue title |

### CRITICAL

1. `path/file.go:42` - Explain the bug, impact, and concrete fix.

### HIGH

1. `path/file.go:80` - Explain the bug, impact, and concrete fix.

### MEDIUM

1. `path/file.go:120` - Explain the issue and recommended fix.

### LOW

1. `path/file.go:160` - Explain the suggestion.

## Summary

- Verdict: `APPROVE`, `COMMENT`, or `REQUEST_CHANGES`
- Reviewed PRs: `<owner>/<repo>#<number>`
- Tests or checks inspected/run: `<commands or not run>`
```

Use these severity meanings:

- `CRITICAL`: exploitable security issue, data loss, financial/accounting
  corruption, or production outage risk.
- `HIGH`: likely behavioral bug, authorization break, migration hazard, or
  missing test for risky behavior.
- `MEDIUM`: maintainability, performance, or edge-case issue that should be
  addressed soon.
- `LOW`: minor improvement or style issue.

If there are no findings, say that clearly and mention residual test gaps.

### 7. Comment Posting

Do not post GitHub comments without explicit user approval. After presenting
findings, ask whether to:

1. post all findings
2. post only selected numbers
3. post only findings at or above a severity
4. skip posting

When posting, prefer inline PR review comments for findings with stable file
and line locations. Use a summary comment for general findings or when inline
positions are unavailable.

### 8. Cleanup

Remove temporary worktrees or branches created only for review. Do not remove
user worktrees, uncommitted user changes, or unrelated branches.

## Slash Commands

- `/everything-coding-agent:review-pr <GitHub PR URL or Issue URL>` - run the
  PR review workflow above.

Plain-language requests such as "このPRをreview-prっぽくレビューして" should trigger
the same workflow.
